* Abstract:
Apache Spark has aimed from the beginning to provide a high-level API for diverse big data workloads. In the past two years, Spark has seen some of the largest API additions since it began in order to meet this goal. In particular, while Spark started out with a functional API based on collections of Java/Python objects, a new series of "structured APIs" including DataFrames, Spark SQL and Structured Streaming are introducing a much more declarative layer that is simultaneously more optimizable. Underneath these APIs, the engine can understand the structure of the data and of user queries, and applies rich optimizations to both computation and storage that are typically not common big data processing frameworks, such as relational optimizations, columnar storage, and code generation. Moreover, these optimizations automatically apply across Spark libraries, including third-party data sources and packages. I will discuss the rationale and design of these APIs, as well as recent additions in this area, such as the incremental Structured Streaming API that provides a simple way to reason about out-of-order data, connections with external systems, and failures.
