* Abstract
After being used and developed by Google since a decade ago, container technology recently becomes a hot topic in data center innovation. With the help of companies like Google, Redhat, CoreOS, Docker etc. The container ecosystem is now flourishing, there are a bunch of tools there to help you package, ship, and run your application almost everywhere from AWS, GCE to your tiny Raspberry PI cluster.</p><p>Although Docker gives users great experience to build and run containers, the industry still believes there are some pieces missing here. That's why CoreOS created APPC(App Container Spec) and worked with Companies like Google, Redhat, CloudFoundry, Mesosphere to push it as a container standard to address problems like image format, runtime spec, networking and other important issues.

rkt (pronounced as Rocket) is a container runtime implementation for APPC created by CoreOS. By having a different design than Docker, it also tries to solve problems like security and composability.

In this talk, Yifan Gu, a maintainer of the CoreOS rkt project, will discuss containers, APPC, rkt in much more details. Hopefully you can get an idea of what's container, why you should begin to use it after the talk.
