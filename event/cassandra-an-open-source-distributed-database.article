* Abstract
Apache Cassandra is perfect for managing large amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data across multiple data centers and the cloud. Cassandra delivers continuous availability, linear scalability, and operational simplicity across many commodity servers with no single point of failure, along with a powerful dynamic data model designed for maximum flexibility and fast response times. Cassandra powers many mission-critical applications at Netflix, Coursera, Intuit, UBS, Nvidia, Safeway, Orbeus, etc. In this talk, we will focus on the core architecture of Cassandra, from read path, write path, internode communication, replication strategy to query language, data modeling, etc. We will also cover the architecture of DataStax Enterprise database platform build on top of Cassandra, tools to manage the Cassandra and the drivers to develop with Cassandra.

* Speaker’ bio
Charles Cao is a Director of Engineering at DataStax. He builds the enterprise-grade Cassandra and the Big Search on top of Cassandra and Solr.
