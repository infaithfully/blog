* Session 1: Tachyon overview
Tachyon is a memory-centric fault-tolerant distributed storage system, which enables reliable file sharing at memory-speed. It was born in UC Berkeley AMPLab. It is open source and is deployed at multiple companies. In addition, Tachyon has more than 100 contributors from over 30 institutions, including Baidu, IBM, Intel, and Yahoo etc. Earlier this year, the latest spinout from AMPLab, Tachyon Nexus, started to commercialize Tachyon. The company is funded by Andreessen Horowitz. It was also recently listed on 9 Hot Enterprise Storage Companies to Watch by Network World and Computer World. In this talk, we present an overview of Tachyon, as well as some recent development and use cases.

* Session 2: Fast big data analytics with Spark on Tachyon in Baidu
In this talk we will focus on how Tachyon can help improve big data analytics (ad-hoc query) efficiency (up to 30x performance improvement) within Baidu. In detail, we will explain: Currently within Baidu, we have a production Tachyon cluster with 150 nodes and over 2 PB of storage space, this cluster mainly serves as the cache layer for our Big Data Analytics engine. In this talk, first we introduce the Big Data Analytic infrastructure within Baidu. Then, we explain why we started using Tachyon several months ago, as well as the problems encountered when we started using Tachyon. Next, we delve into the details of how Tachyon help accelerate our Big Data Analytics pipeline at its current state. At the end, we discuss what new features we want to see and the plan to scale further.
