* Abstract
Apache Samza is an open source stream processing framework designed for continuous data processing. Unlike batch processing systems such as Hadoop which typically has high-latency responses (sometimes hours), Samza continuously computes results as data arrives which makes sub-second response times possible. Samza has some unique features that make it powerful. It provides high performance for stateful processing jobs, including aggregation and joins between many input streams. It is designed to support an ecosystem of many different jobs written by different teams, and it isolates them from each other, so that one badly behaved job can’t affect the others.

At LinkedIn, we have been using Samza in production both for internal analytic purposes and for data products that are served on the live site. In this talk, we will focus on detailed architecture of Samza, and comparison with other major open-sourced streaming process frameworks.
