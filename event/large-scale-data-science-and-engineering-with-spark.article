* Abstract
Apache Spark has taken Big Data by storm, subsuming Hadoop MapReduce. In this talk, Reynold Xin from Databricks will give a quick introduction to Spark, with a focus on the latest development activities aimed at making large-scale data science and engineering more approachable. In particular, the following will be discussed:

- Spark's basic programming API
- the new DataFrame API for big data
- machine learning pipeline integration
- Databricks Cloud

* Speaker’ bio
Reynold Xin is a committer and PMC member on Apache Spark. He is also a co-founder of Databricks. He has been instrumental in the development of Spark as the maintainer of many components. He recently led an effort to scale up Spark and set a new world record in 100 TB sorting (Daytona Gray). Before Databricks, he was pursuing a PhD at UC Berkeley AMPLab. He wrote the two highest cited papers in SIGMOD 2011 and SIGMOD 2013.
