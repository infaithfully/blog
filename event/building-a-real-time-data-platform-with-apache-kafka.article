* Abstract
Apache Kafka is a high throughput, distributed messaging system. Since it's open sourced, various companies such as Twitter, Netflix, Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest have adopted Kafka in their big data eco-system. In this talk, Jun will first explain how typical companies are using Kafka and the importance of Kafka in the whole big data eco-system. Next, Jun will describe some of the underlying technologies in Kafka that helped make it popular. Finally, Jun will introduce what we are doing at Confluent to build a Kafka-based real time data platform.
